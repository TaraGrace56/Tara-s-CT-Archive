### Important Notice
_Please bare in mind that currently this archive is a work in progress. Not everything will be present here yet in terms of tracks but also information. You can find all my tracks on the [Wii](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/User:Tara) and [Double Dash](https://mkdd.org/wiki/User:Tara) wikis in the mean time._
# Tara's CT Archive
Welcome to Tara's Mario Kart Custom Track Archive. Here you can find all my track releases across both Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Kart Wii, which also comes with information regarding what track they should replace and a detailed changelog. For Mario Kart Wii, I focus mainly on creating new design tracks which have new layouts and themes. However, for Mario Kart Double Dash, I will be mainly focusing on retro tracks with the aim of having every single Mario Kart track playable in Double Dash. (this doesn't mean I will be making every track, just that every track will be remade on the [Wiki](https://mkdd.org/wiki/List_of_Retro_Tracks))
### Permissions
You may update my tracks for bug fixing reasons, however if you would like to make larger gameplay or visual changes to my tracks then you will need to ask for permission via the comments on the tracks most recent [showcase video.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDL_ktAYVWk-f_ur599lOBahYXqrpsmPl)
# Navigation
This archive is split into two parts: tracks for Wii and tracks for Double Dash. From there, you will then see all the tracks that are available for the game. When you click on one of them folders, you see all the available versions that you can play however it is recommended to use the most recent version of each track. Each part will also have it's own bug tracker to inform you of what bugs are known and if they will be fixed. If you would like to report a bug, then please comment on the tracks most recent showcase video.


_A screenshot showcasing the structure of one of parts will be here_


Each track will be provided with a summary as to what the track is about, what track it should or has to replace and, if needed, an explanation as to why, the lap count (for Wii this would require the use of a distribution that can change lap counts or a gecko code) and a detailed changelog to tell you what is different between each version.

# Track Update System
All of my tracks are updated using a consistent update system. The update system follows a set pattern, these are in the format Release, Feature Update, Bug Fix Update for example, 1.4.2 or 2.5.21. However you may also see Betas across some of my tracks before they follow with the pattern previously mentioned. Below is what each update represents, how frequent these updates are and some examples.
### Release Number
This is exclusively for overhauls to the track, this number will rarely change.
* Track design overhauls.
* Visual overhauls.
### Feature Update Number
This is for smaller updates that make changes to releases that add, alter or remove features. These are more common than overhauls but do not change as much.
* Texture change.
* Small layout changes.
### Bug Fix Update Number
These updates are for bug fixes and hotfix updates, these typically are the most common with multiple bug fixes in one update.
* Fixing unintended shortcuts based on feedback.
* Fixing parts to a track that don't look or behave as intended, or may cause flickering and crashes.
### Beta Releases
This will be used for tracks that require a lot more work before they become a full release. These will receive inconsistent updates however will primarily change a lot, similar to a new release.
# How To Play
The way to play custom tracks will vary depending on the game.
### Wii
In order to play custom tracks for Mario Kart Wii, you will need to also have a distribution that has a 'MyStuff' folder. From there, you can place the track/s in the folder and have it enabled to play. Depending on the distribution, you may need to have the distribution itself disabled as not every distribution keeps the original 32 tracks playable which are the tracks that would be replaced by the track/s in the 'MyStuff' folder. Alternatively, you can also create a custom track testing pack.
### Double Dash
In order to play custom tracks for Mario Kart Double Dash, you will need to also have the MKDD Patcher or MKDD Extender which will allow you to place the tracks into the game.
