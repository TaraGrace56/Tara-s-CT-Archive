### Important Notice
_Please bare in mind that currently this archive is a work in progress. Not everything will be present here yet in terms of tracks but also information. You can find all my tracks on the [Wii](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/User:Tara) and [Double Dash](https://mkdd.org/wiki/User:Tara) wikis in the mean time._
# Tara's CT Archive
Welcome to Tara's Mario Kart Custom Track Archive. Here you can find all my track releases across both Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Kart Wii, which also comes with information regarding what track they should replace and a detailed changelog. For Mario Kart Wii, I focus mainly on creating new design tracks which have new layouts and themes. However, for Mario Kart Double Dash, I will be mainly focusing on retro tracks with the aim of having every single Mario Kart track playable in Double Dash. (this doesn't mean I will be making every track, just that every track will be remade on the [Wiki](https://mkdd.org/wiki/List_of_Retro_Tracks))
## Permissions
You may update my tracks for bug fixing reasons, however if you would like to make larger gameplay or visual changes to my tracks then you will need to ask for permission via the comments on the tracks most recent [showcase video.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDL_ktAYVWk-f_ur599lOBahYXqrpsmPl)
# Navigation
This archive is split into two parts: tracks for Wii and tracks for Double Dash. From there, you will then see all the tracks that are available for the game. When you click on one of them folders, you see all the available versions that you can play however it is recommended to use the most recent version of each track.
_A screenshot showcasing the structure of one of parts will be here_
Each track will be provided with a summary as to what the track is about, what track it should or has to replace and, if needed, an explanation as to why, the lap count (for Wii this would require the use of a distribution that can change lap counts or a gecko code) also a detailed changelog to tell you what is different between each version.
