### Desert Castle Raceway
Desert Castle Raceway is a custom track created by lgmb. It is a long track placed in a desert. This starts in a stony castle, then it goes into a highway with cars and trucks up to a certain point. After that, there is a sandy part near the castle with some ramps, a lake, a bridge, and a part in the castle with a loop and many boost panels. A cloud then leads to a temple and the lap is finished after making a few more jumps. This is a major overhaul to the track credited by myself and Vrock02 which sees major visual changes and some minor gameplay tweaks.
## Slot Requirements
The track will only work on Daisy Circuit (senior_course.szs) and DS Desert Hills (old_desert_ds.szs) due to the angry sun object.
## Credits
- [JorisMKW](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/JorisMKW) for the turrets from [Desert Fort](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Desert_Fort).
- [BrawlBox](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Brawlboxgaming) for making the minimap.
- CTGP Track Testers for feedback and help with the lightmap.
## Lap Count
The track's lap count is set to 2. For this to be accurate, you will need to use a pack which has lap count changing implemented (eg. CTGP or a Pulsar testing pack) or a gecko code. Without these, the lap count will remain at 3 laps.
