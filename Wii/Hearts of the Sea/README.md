# Hearts of the Sea
Hearts of the Sea was a Minecraft base project I began in 2021 having just created a brand new world. It was simply just hearts on the bottom of the seabed which added as an opening into the base itself. However, I didn't get far into it as I lost the world due to a powercut whilst afk'ing one of my automated farms. In the space of seconds, I went from having the world of my dreams in the making to having nothing to show for my efforts. Rather than just recreating the build in a different world, maybe even using the same seed, so I didn't tarnish the memories of the original I promised myself I would never build it again. But that didn't mean not turning it into a ct!

Last year, I decided to bring back Hearts of the Sea as a custom track with the intention of putting this concept to rest and having a finalised product which can live on. Whilst in some ways this did do the job, in others it did not and as a result I got a lot of feedback from within CTGP track testers and thus began working on an overhaul. It's took a lot longer than it should have, but it's finally here! It's safe to say that this isn't going to be a worldy of a track, I'm not expecting that at all. It has a lot of areas still lacking, in particular with the visuals. But I've already done pretty much all of my ideas thus I feel confident in wrapping this now up. I hope you enjoy the finished Hearts of the Sea. You can find a showcase for V2.0 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66eB0NLWIEU).
