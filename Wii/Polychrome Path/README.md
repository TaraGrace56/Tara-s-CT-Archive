# Polychrome Path
Polychrome Path is a custom track which takes on the concept 'What if Rainbow Road, typically the hardest track in a Mario Kart game, was designed for the Mushroom or Flower Cups.' v1.0 â€“ v1.1.1 feature three hairpin turns to start, with jump ramps for tricks and a split path section to end the lap. However, v2.0 features a revised layout and visuals to create a more complete and interesting track whilst retaining the same concept. You can find a showcase for V2.0 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAdQ6FJ_5zQ&t=37s).
## Slot Requirements
The track will work on every slot however it is recommended use Rainbow Road (rainbow_course.szs) due to the road and wall collision sound effects.
